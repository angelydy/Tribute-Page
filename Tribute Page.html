            <p id="biographyinfo">
                Born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey, Houston almost seemed destined from birth to become a singer.<br>
                Her mother and cousin were both legendary figures in American gospel, soul and pop music. Cissy Houston was the<br>
                choir minister at New Hope Baptist Church, and it was there that a young Houston got her start. Even as a child,<br>
                Houston was able to wow audiences; she later told Diane Sawyer that a rapturous response from the congregation at <br>
                New Hope had a powerful effect upon her: "I think I knew then that [my singing ability] was an infectious thing that<br>
                God had given me."
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                By the time she turned 15, Houston was performing often with her mother and trying to get a record deal of her own.<br>
                Around the same time, she was discovered by a photographer who was awed by her natural beauty. She soon became an<br>
                extremely sought-after teen model, one of the first African American women to appear on the cover of Seventeen magazine.<br>
                But music remained her true love.
