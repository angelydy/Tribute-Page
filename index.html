                    Born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey, Houston almost seemed destined from birth to become a singer.<br>
                    Her mother and cousin were both legendary figures in American gospel, soul and pop music. Cissy Houston was the<br>
                    choir minister at New Hope Baptist Church, and it was there that a young Houston got her start. Even as a child,<br>
                    Houston was able to wow audiences; she later told Diane Sawyer that a rapturous response from the congregation at <br>
                    New Hope had a powerful effect upon her: "I think I knew then that [my singing ability] was an infectious thing that<br>

                    extremely sought-after teen model, one of the first African American women to appear on the cover of Seventeen magazine.<br>
                    But music remained her true love.
