                    Born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey, Houston almost seemed destined from birth to become a singer.
                    Her mother and cousin were both legendary figures in American gospel, soul and pop music. Cissy Houston was the
                    choir minister at New Hope Baptist Church, and it was there that a young Houston got her start. Even as a child,
                    Houston was able to wow audiences; she later told Diane Sawyer that a rapturous response from the congregation at 
                    New Hope had a powerful effect upon her: "I think I knew then that [my singing ability] was an infectious thing that
                    God had given me."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By the time she turned 15, Houston was performing often with her mother and trying to get a record deal of her own.
                    Around the same time, she was discovered by a photographer who was awed by her natural beauty. She soon became an
                    extremely sought-after teen model, one of the first African American women to appear on the cover of Seventeen magazine.
                    But music remained her true love.
